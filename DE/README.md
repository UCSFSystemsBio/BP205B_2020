Here are the Differential expression gene lists for HCC_AA and HCC-MK. Comparisons are made both pairwise or using one group versus the rest. The volcano plot shows all the genes with p-value < 0.05 in the dataset. Genes with the absolute value of log2foldchange > 1 are marked in red and are listed in the corresponding cvs file.
